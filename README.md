# FirstCodingRepository

This repository contains Duplicates.java, Factorial.java, longName.java, and Methods.java. Duplicates.java takes an ArrayList of Integers and prints a new ArrayList with duplicates removed. Factorial.java takes an inputted integer and prints the factorial of that number. longName.java takes as many names as the user wants. However, once the user inputs “X”, the code prints the longest name that was inputted. Methods.java is a java file that contains many methods, including a method that checks if numbers are prime, a method that checks if a string is a palindrome, a bubble sort method, and more.
